  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Pilau is a flavorful spiced rice dish popular along the East African coast, especially in Kenya and Tanzania.<br> 
    Made with fragrant spices like cinnamon, cloves, cumin, and cardamom, Pilau is traditionally cooked with rice, meat (usually beef or goat),<br>
    onions, and garlic, creating a rich, aromatic meal. Itâ€™s often served at special occasions and pairs well with kachumbari (fresh tomato onion salad)<br>
    or a side of vegetables.
