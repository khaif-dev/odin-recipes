    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chapati is a soft, unleavened flatbread commonly made in East Africa and South Asia. It’s made by mixing wheat flour, water,<br>
       and a bit of salt or sugar into a soft dough, which is then rolled out into thin circles and cooked on a hot pan with a light<br>
       brushing of oil/ghee. The result is a golden, slightly puffed, tender bread perfect for scooping up stews or veggies.

      <li>Let the coils rest for 5-10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Roll each coil gently into a round chapati again.</li>
      <li>Heat a pan over medium heat and cook each chapati 30-45 seconds on one side then flip.</li>
